 Augmented-Reality-NPM
=====================

Augmented-Reality-NPM (藏‧故宮) is an android App using Augmented Reality (especially using Imaga Rceognition) for museium touring. 

This App is inspired and extended from Qualcomm Vuforia ( https://www.vuforia.com ), and AR library for mobile devices.

I have build sample Image Targets for contest purpose. but you may want to build your own.

Here is whow it works (With My image targets) 
1.Install compiled APK (in Ref Kits dir.)
2.Launch it and aim to sample Image ( My purpose is to aim paintings in museiums )

3.A dialog introducing the painting you aimed Poped.

Some of the introductions are made both for Traditional Chionese (mainly) and English.

Please be aware: I made this project for my NPM Contest in 2013 and all the image targets are made for contest only.
